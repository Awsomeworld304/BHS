- **Keep your software updated**: Regularly check for updates and apply patches as they become available.
- **Principle of least privilege**: Run the software with the minimum required permissions.
- **Secure your environment**: Ensure that your server and network configurations follow recommended security guidelines.
- **Monitor and log**: Implement monitoring and logging to track activity and detect any unusual behavior.
